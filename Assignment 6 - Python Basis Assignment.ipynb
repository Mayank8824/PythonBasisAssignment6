    "\n",
    "1. Use Meaningful Names:\n",
    "Choose variable names that convey their purpose or content. Avoid single-letter names (except for simple loop counters) and opt for descriptive names.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Use Lowercase with Underscores (Snake Case):\n",
    "Separate words in variable names with underscores (e.g., my_variable, user_age). This convention enhances readability.\n",

    "Constants, like configuration values, are often named using uppercase letters and underscores (e.g., MAX_LENGTH, PI).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Class Names:\n",
    "Class names should follow the CapWords convention (also known as CamelCase), where each word starts with an uppercase letter (e.g., MyClass, PersonInfo).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Private Variables:\n",
    "Variables that are considered \"private\" should start with a single underscore (e.g., _private_variable). This indicates that the variable should not be accessed directly from outside the class or module.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.Protected Variables:\n",
